# tfjson

This library is based on [hashicorp/terraform-json](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-json) and provides
support for handling JSON outputs for `t`erra`f`orm and open`t`o`f`u.

It includes improvements that are backported from internal libraries and functions,
used in Terramate Cloud to handle JSON generated by

- [`terraform show -json`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/show.html#json-output)
- [`terraform providers schema -json`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/providers/schema.html#json)
- [`tofu show -json`](https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/commands/show/#json-output)
- [`tofu providers schema -json`](https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/commands/providers/schema.html#json)

## Should I use this library?

This library is used in Terramate CLI to improve handling of JSON outputs for Terraform and OpenTofu on the client-side before data is send to Terramate Cloud.

It does not provide any guarantees of compatibility with other applications or future versions.

Please do not depend on this library without contacting us first and share your use case.
